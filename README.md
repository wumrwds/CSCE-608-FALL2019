## Frontend

Use Vue.js + Element UI to build up. 

Open the `blog-frontend` directory, then run `npm run start` in cmd can see the frontend pages. After developing, we can run `npm run build_prd` to generate the html and js codes. Then we can add them into the backend project as the static pages.



##  Backend
